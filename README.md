# Google Scripts

These are scripts I have written for work projects that I wanted to both showcase as well as save for future tweaking and work.

They are saved in .js files to make it easier to read, though they are currently copied and pasted into Google's Script online editor.

To see an example of what a full project looks like, see my "Full Hide and Unhide Script Example.js" file. The "Hide-Unhide Boilerplate.js" file is for my personal use as I reproduce this project for future/ongoing projects.
